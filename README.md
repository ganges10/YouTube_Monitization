# YouTube_Monitization
## Case Study:
Design a system similar to YOUTUBE, where a person can own channels, manage them and be creators
for a living. The channel has to be reviewed with COPPA Act. The system can have 4 types of
monitization (card, banner, skippable and non skippable ad). The revenue differs from one ad to another.
In order to monitize the channel, you should have 1000 subscribers and 4000 hours of watch time (i.e.
time for which people have viewed your videos). If you donâ€™t have copyrights, then the owner has the
right to claim your complete revenue of that video. Fund raising could be done in the links provided in the
description (in-built feature). Offensive comments with inappropriate language have to be automatically
removed. Auto-generated subtitles could be added as a feature, or even a user could offer for a subtitle
script and get paid for it.
